## Requirements

- **Base Game**: CK3 version 1.12+
- **Optional DLC**: Royal Court, Tours & Tournaments, Wards & Wardens, Legends of the Dead
  - Mod works without DLC but has fewer features

## How to Use

### Getting Your First Dragon

1. **Start with Valyrian Blood**: Create a custom character with Ancient Valyrian trait
2. **Find a Dragon**: Use the "Claim Wild Dragon" decision (requires 200 prestige)
3. **Success Factors**:
   - Valyrian blood: +40% chance
   - High prowess: +30% chance
   - Brave trait: +20% chance
   - Dragon temperament matters
   - Dragon size matters (smaller = easier)

### Dragon Combat

- Challenge rival dragon riders to duels
- Winner determined by dragon size + rider skill + luck
- Loser dies along with their dragon
- Winner gains massive prestige and dread

### Breeding Dragons

- Dragon riders have 10% annual chance to get egg
- Eggs take 5 years minimum to hatch
- Dragon Pit building speeds up hatching
- Dragon Keeper court position helps

### Dynasty Legacies

Unlock the Dragon Blood legacy track:
1. Inherited Fire: +10% taming chance
2. Ancient Compact: +15% taming, more Valyrian births
3. Dragon Dreams: Can have prophetic visions
4. Fire Made Flesh: +25% taming, +3 prowess
5. Blood of the Dragon: +50% taming, death immunity, hatch stone eggs

## Balance

- Dragon claiming is dangerous without Valyrian blood
- Failed attempts can kill your character
- Dragons die in combat permanently
- Ancient dragons are extremely powerful
- Dragon riders get +8 prowess, +2 martial, +25 dread

## Compatibility

Should be compatible with most mods. Potential conflicts:
- Mods that heavily modify artifacts
- Mods that change combat mechanics
- Other fantasy mods with dragons

## Known Issues

None currently. Please report bugs!

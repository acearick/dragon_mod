 # Hatchling -> Young (Age 11)
 dragon_aging_expanded.0010.t:0 "A Dragon Comes of Age"
 dragon_aging_expanded.0010.desc:0 "After years of growth, my dragon has finally reached maturity. No longer a hatchling dependent on my care, it has become a young dragon capable of bearing a rider into battle. Its wings have grown strong enough to carry us both, and its fire burns hot enough to melt steel. A new chapter begins."

 dragon_aging_expanded.0050.desc:0 "Three hundred years. My dragon has lived for three hundred years—longer than any dragon in living memory, longer than the oldest histories record. It has become something more than a mere beast, something approaching the divine. Scholars will write of this creature for centuries to come. To be its rider in these final years is an honor beyond measure."
